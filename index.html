            <h2>About EThekwini</h2>
            <p>EThekwini Municipality is a Category A municipality found in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
                 The area is topographically hilly, with many gorges and ravines, and almost no true coastal plain. Durban has
                a turbulent history dating from ivory hunters in the 1820s and their conflict with the local Zulu monarchs.
                We are a diverse African city that is focused on citywide investment, growing our economy and creating a better 
                quality of life. In Durban we play hard and we work hard.

                    <p>
                        A good starting point for a walking tour of Durban is the "Golden Mile." This bustling beachfront promenade is lined with high-rise hotels,
                        entertainment complexes, shops, and restaurants. The broad, golden beaches are a magnet for water sports enthusiasts who come
                        here to surf, swim, fish, or just bask in the sunshine. Lifeguards and shark nets protect most of the beaches year-round. One can certainly enjoy.

                 of this spectacularly beautiful terrain where the mighty Zulu nation was forged.</p>
